## Introduction

Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book
[*Clean Code*](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882),
adapted for PHP. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing
readable, reusable, and refactorable software in PHP.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be universally
agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are ones codified over many
years of collective experience by the authors of the *Clean Code*.

Inspired by [clean-code-javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript).

Although many developers still use PHP 5, most of the examples in this article only work with PHP 7.1+.

## Variables

### Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names

**Bad:**

```php
$ymdstr = $moment->format('y-m-d');
```

**Good:**

```php
$currentDate = $moment->format('y-m-d');
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
- $ymdstr = $moment->format('y-m-d');
+ $currentDate = $moment->format('y-m-d');
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use the same vocabulary for the same type of variable

**Bad:**

```php
getUserInfo();
getUserData();
getUserRecord();
getUserProfile();
```

**Good:**

```php
getUser();
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
- getUserInfo();
- getUserData();
- getUserRecord();
- getUserProfile();
+ getUser();
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use searchable names (part 1)

We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we do write is
readable and searchable. By *not* naming variables that end up being meaningful for
understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable.

**Bad:**

```php
// What the heck is 448 for?
$result = $serializer->serialize($data, 448);
```

**Good:**

```php
$json = $serializer->serialize($data, JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES | JSON_PRETTY_PRINT | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE);
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
- $result = $serializer->serialize($data, 448);
+ $json = $serializer->serialize($data, JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES | JSON_PRETTY_PRINT | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE);
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use searchable names (part 2)

**Bad:**

```php
class User
{
    // What the heck is 7 for?
    public $access = 7;
}

// What the heck is 4 for?
if ($user->access & 4) {
    // ...
}

// What's going on here?
$user->access ^= 2;
```

**Good:**

```php
class User
{
    public const ACCESS_READ = 1;

    public const ACCESS_CREATE = 2;

    public const ACCESS_UPDATE = 4;

    public const ACCESS_DELETE = 8;

    // User as default can read, create and update something
    public $access = self::ACCESS_READ | self::ACCESS_CREATE | self::ACCESS_UPDATE;
}

if ($user->access & User::ACCESS_UPDATE) {
    // do edit ...
}

// Deny access rights to create something
$user->access ^= User::ACCESS_CREATE;
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
class User
{
-    public $access = 7;
+    public const ACCESS_READ = 1;
+
+    public const ACCESS_CREATE = 2;
+
+    public const ACCESS_UPDATE = 4;
+
+    public const ACCESS_DELETE = 8;
+
+    public $access = self::ACCESS_READ | self::ACCESS_CREATE | self::ACCESS_UPDATE;
}

- if ($user->access & 4) {
+ if ($user->access & User::ACCESS_UPDATE) {
}

- $user->access ^= 2;
+ $user->access ^= User::ACCESS_CREATE;
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use explanatory variables

**Bad:**

```php
$address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014';
$cityZipCodeRegex = '/^[^,]+,\s*(.+?)\s*(\d{5})$/';
preg_match($cityZipCodeRegex, $address, $matches);

saveCityZipCode($matches[1], $matches[2]);
```

**Not bad:**

It's better, but we are still heavily dependent on regex.

```php
$address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014';
$cityZipCodeRegex = '/^[^,]+,\s*(.+?)\s*(\d{5})$/';
preg_match($cityZipCodeRegex, $address, $matches);

[, $city, $zipCode] = $matches;
saveCityZipCode($city, $zipCode);
```

**Good:**

Decrease dependence on regex by naming subpatterns.

```php
$address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014';
$cityZipCodeRegex = '/^[^,]+,\s*(?<city>.+?)\s*(?<zipCode>\d{5})$/';
preg_match($cityZipCodeRegex, $address, $matches);

saveCityZipCode($matches['city'], $matches['zipCode']);
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
$address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014';
- $cityZipCodeRegex = '/^[^,]+,\s*(.+?)\s*(\d{5})$/';
+ $cityZipCodeRegex = '/^[^,]+,\s*(?<city>.+?)\s*(?<zipCode>\d{5})$/';
preg_match($cityZipCodeRegex, $address, $matches);

- saveCityZipCode($matches[1], $matches[2]);
- [, $city, $zipCode] = $matches;
- saveCityZipCode($city, $zipCode);
+ saveCityZipCode($matches['city'], $matches['zipCode']);
```

### Avoid nesting too deeply and return early (part 1)

Too many if-else statements can make your code hard to follow. Explicit is better
than implicit.

**Bad:**

```php
function isShopOpen($day): bool
{
    if ($day) {
        if (is_string($day)) {
            $day = strtolower($day);
            if ($day === 'friday') {
                return true;
            } elseif ($day === 'saturday') {
                return true;
            } elseif ($day === 'sunday') {
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
        return false;
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function isShopOpen(string $day): bool
{
    if (empty($day)) {
        return false;
    }

    $openingDays = ['friday', 'saturday', 'sunday'];

    return in_array(strtolower($day), $openingDays, true);
}
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
- function isShopOpen($day): bool
+ function isShopOpen(string $day): bool
{
-    if ($day) {
-        if (is_string($day)) {
-            $day = strtolower($day);
-            if ($day === 'friday') {
-                return true;
-            } elseif ($day === 'saturday') {
-                return true;
-            } elseif ($day === 'sunday') {
-                return true;
-            }
-            return false;
-        }
-        return false;
-    }
-    return false;
+    if (empty($day)) {
+        return false;
+    }
+
+    $openingDays = ['friday', 'saturday', 'sunday'];
+
+    return in_array(strtolower($day), $openingDays, true);
}
```

### Avoid nesting too deeply and return early (part 2)

**Bad:**

```php
function fibonacci(int $n)
{
    if ($n < 50) {
        if ($n !== 0) {
            if ($n !== 1) {
                return fibonacci($n - 1) + fibonacci($n - 2);
            }
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
    return 'Not supported';
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function fibonacci(int $n): int
{
    if ($n === 0 || $n === 1) {
        return $n;
    }

    if ($n >= 50) {
        throw new Exception('Not supported');
    }

    return fibonacci($n - 1) + fibonacci($n - 2);
}
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
- function fibonacci(int $n)
+ function fibonacci(int $n): int
{
-    if ($n < 50) {
-        if ($n !== 0) {
-            if ($n !== 1) {
-                return fibonacci($n - 1) + fibonacci($n - 2);
-            }
-            return 1;
-        }
-        return 0;
-    }
-    return 'Not supported';
+    if ($n === 0 || $n === 1) {
+        return $n;
+    }
+
+    if ($n >= 50) {
+        throw new Exception('Not supported');
+    }
+
+    return fibonacci($n - 1) + fibonacci($n - 2);
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid Mental Mapping

Don’t force the reader of your code to translate what the variable means.
Explicit is better than implicit.

**Bad:**

```php
$l = ['Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco'];

for ($i = 0; $i < count($l); $i++) {
    $li = $l[$i];
    doStuff();
    doSomeOtherStuff();
    // ...
    // ...
    // ...
    // Wait, what is `$li` for again?
    dispatch($li);
}
```

**Good:**

```php
$locations = ['Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco'];

foreach ($locations as $location) {
    doStuff();
    doSomeOtherStuff();
    // ...
    // ...
    // ...
    dispatch($location);
}
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
- $l = ['Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco'];
+ $locations = ['Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco'];

- for ($i = 0; $i < count($l); $i++) {
-    $li = $l[$i];
+ foreach ($locations as $location) {
    doStuff();
    doSomeOtherStuff();
    // ...
    // ...
    // ...
-    dispatch($li);
+    dispatch($location);
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don't add unneeded context

If your class/object name tells you something, don't repeat that in your
variable name.

**Bad:**

```php
class Car
{
    public $carMake;

    public $carModel;

    public $carColor;

    //...
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class Car
{
    public $make;

    public $model;

    public $color;

    //...
}
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
class Car
{
-    public $carMake;
+    public $make;

-    public $carModel;
+    public $model;

-    public $carColor;
+    public $color;

    //...
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Comparison

### Use [identical comparison](http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php)

**Not good:**

The simple comparison will convert the string into an integer.

```php
$a = '42';
$b = 42;

if ($a != $b) {
    // The expression will always pass
}
```

The comparison `$a != $b` returns `FALSE` but in fact it's `TRUE`!
The string `42` is different from the integer `42`.

**Good:**

The identical comparison will compare type and value.

```php
$a = '42';
$b = 42;

if ($a !== $b) {
    // The expression is verified
}
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
$a = '42';
$b = 42;

- if ($a != $b) {
+ if ($a !== $b) {
    //
}
```

The comparison `$a !== $b` returns `TRUE`.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Null coalescing operator

Null coalescing is a new operator [introduced in PHP 7](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php). The null coalescing operator `??` has been added as syntactic sugar for the common case of needing to use a ternary in conjunction with `isset()`. It returns its first operand if it exists and is not `null`; otherwise, it returns its second operand.

**Bad:**

```php
if (isset($_GET['name'])) {
    $name = $_GET['name'];
} elseif (isset($_POST['name'])) {
    $name = $_POST['name'];
} else {
    $name = 'nobody';
}
```

**Good:**
```php
$name = $_GET['name'] ?? $_POST['name'] ?? 'nobody';
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
- if (isset($_GET['name'])) {
-    $name = $_GET['name'];
- } elseif (isset($_POST['name'])) {
-    $name = $_POST['name'];
- } else {
-    $name = 'nobody';
-}
+ $name = $_GET['name'] ?? $_POST['name'] ?? 'nobody';
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Functions

### Use default arguments instead of short-circuiting or conditionals

**Not good:**

This is not good because `$breweryName` can be `NULL`.

```php
function createMicrobrewery($breweryName = 'Hipster Brew Co.'): void
{
    // ...
}
```

**Not bad:**

This opinion is more understandable than the previous version, but it better controls the value of the variable.

```php
function createMicrobrewery($name = null): void
{
    $breweryName = $name ?: 'Hipster Brew Co.';
    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

 You can use [type hinting](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php) and be sure that the `$breweryName` will not be `NULL`.

```php
function createMicrobrewery(string $breweryName = 'Hipster Brew Co.'): void
{
    // ...
}
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
- function createMicrobrewery($breweryName = 'Hipster Brew Co.'): void
- function createMicrobrewery($name = null): void
+ function createMicrobrewery(string $breweryName = 'Hipster Brew Co.'): void
{
-    $breweryName = $name ?: 'Hipster Brew Co.';
    // ...
}
```

### Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)

Limiting the number of function parameters is incredibly important because it makes
testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a combinatorial explosion
where you have to test tons of different cases with each separate argument.

Zero arguments are the ideal case. One or two arguments are ok, and three should be avoided.
Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have more than two
arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases where it's not, most
of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an argument.

**Bad:**

```php
class Questionnaire
{
    public function __construct(
        string $firstname,
        string $lastname,
        string $patronymic,
        string $region,
        string $district,
        string $city,
        string $phone,
        string $email
    ) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class Name
{
    private $firstname;

    private $lastname;

    private $patronymic;

    public function __construct(string $firstname, string $lastname, string $patronymic)
    {
        $this->firstname = $firstname;
        $this->lastname = $lastname;
        $this->patronymic = $patronymic;
    }

    // getters ...
}

class City
{
    private $region;

    private $district;

    private $city;

    public function __construct(string $region, string $district, string $city)
    {
        $this->region = $region;
        $this->district = $district;
        $this->city = $city;
    }

    // getters ...
}

class Contact
{
    private $phone;

    private $email;

    public function __construct(string $phone, string $email)
    {
        $this->phone = $phone;
        $this->email = $email;
    }

    // getters ...
}

class Questionnaire
{
    public function __construct(Name $name, City $city, Contact $contact)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
+class Name
+{
+    private $firstname;
+
+    private $lastname;
+
+    private $patronymic;
+
+    public function __construct(string $firstname, string $lastname, string $patronymic)
+    {
+        $this->firstname = $firstname;
+        $this->lastname = $lastname;
+        $this->patronymic = $patronymic;
+    }
+
+    // getters ...

+
+class City

+    {
+        $this->region = $region;
+        $this->district = $district;
+        $this->city = $city;
+    }
+
+    // getters ...

+
+class Contact
+{

+

-    ) {
+    public function __construct(Name $name, City $city, Contact $contact)
+    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Function names should say what they do

**Bad:**

```php
class Email
{
    //...

    public function handle(): void
    {
        mail($this->to, $this->subject, $this->body);
    }
}

$message = new Email(...);
// What is this? A handle for the message? Are we writing to a file now?
$message->handle();
```

**Good:**

```php
class Email
{
    //...

    public function send(): void
    {
        mail($this->to, $this->subject, $this->body);
    }
}

$message = new Email(...);
// Clear and obvious
$message->send();
```

**Refactor:**

```diff
class Email
{
    //...

-    public function handle(): void
+    public function send(): void
    {
        mail($this->to, $this->subject, $this->body);
    }
}

$message = new Email(...);
//
- $message->handle();
+ $message->send();
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Functions should only be one level of abstraction

When you have more than one level of abstraction your function is usually
doing too much. Splitting up functions leads to reusability and easier
testing.

**Bad:**

```php
function parseBetterPHPAlternative(string $code): void
{
    $regexes = [
        // ...
    ];

    $statements = explode(' ', $code);
    $tokens = [];
    foreach ($regexes as $regex) {
        foreach ($statements as $statement) {
            // ...
        }
    }

    $ast = [];
    foreach ($tokens as $token) {
        // lex...
    }

    foreach ($ast as $node) {
        // parse...
    }
}
```

**Bad too:**

We have carried out some of the functionality, but the `parseBetterPHPAlternative()` function is still very complex and not testable.

```php
function tokenize(string $code): array
{
    $regexes = [
        // ...
    ];

    $statements = explode(' ', $code);
    $tokens = [];
    foreach ($regexes as $regex) {
        foreach ($statements as $statement) {
            $tokens[] = /* ... */;
        }
    }

    return $tokens;
}

function lexer(array $tokens): array
{
    $ast = [];
    foreach ($tokens as $token) {
        $ast[] = /* ... */;
    }

    return $ast;
}

function parseBetterPHPAlternative(string $code): void
{
    $tokens = tokenize($code);
    $ast = lexer($tokens);
    foreach ($ast as $node) {
        // parse...
    }
}
```

**Good:**

The best solution is to move out the dependencies of the `parseBetterPHPAlternative()` function.

```php
class Tokenizer
{
    public function tokenize(string $code): array
    {
        $regexes = [
            // ...
        ];

        $statements = explode(' ', $code);
        $tokens = [];
        foreach ($regexes as $regex) {
            foreach ($statements as $statement) {
                $tokens[] = /* ... */;
            }
        }

        return $tokens;
    }
}

class Lexer
{
    public function lexify(array $tokens): array
    {
        $ast = [];
        foreach ($tokens as $token) {
            $ast[] = /* ... */;
        }

        return $ast;
    }
}

class BetterPHPAlternative
{
    private $tokenizer;
    private $lexer;

    public function __construct(Tokenizer $tokenizer, Lexer $lexer)
    {
        $this->tokenizer = $tokenizer;
        $this->lexer = $lexer;
    }

    public function parse(string $code): void
    {
        $tokens = $this->tokenizer->tokenize($code);
        $ast = $this->lexer->lexify($tokens);
        foreach ($ast as $node) {
            // parse...
        }
    }
}
```

**Refactor:**

```diff

### Don't use flags as function parameters

Flags tell your user that this function does more than one thing. Functions should
do one thing. Split out your functions if they are following different code paths
based on a boolean.

**Bad:**

```php
function createFile(string $name, bool $temp = false): void
{
    if ($temp) {
        touch('./temp/' . $name);
    } else {
        touch($name);
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function createFile(string $name): void
{
    touch($name);
}

function createTempFile(string $name): void
{
    touch('./temp/' . $name);
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid Side Effects

A function produces a side effect if it does anything other than take a value in and
return another value or values. A side effect could be writing to a file, modifying
some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a stranger.

Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous
example, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to centralize where
you are doing this. Don't have several functions and classes that write to a particular
file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.

The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing states between objects without
any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything, and not
centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will be happier
than the vast majority of other programmers.

**Bad:**

```php
// Global variable referenced by following function.
// If we had another function that used this name, now it'd be an array and it could break it.
$name = 'Ryan McDermott';

function splitIntoFirstAndLastName(): void
{
    global $name;

    $name = explode(' ', $name);
}

splitIntoFirstAndLastName();

var_dump($name);
// ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```

**Good:**

```php
function splitIntoFirstAndLastName(string $name): array
{
    return explode(' ', $name);
}

$name = 'Ryan McDermott';
$newName = splitIntoFirstAndLastName($name);

var_dump($name);
// 'Ryan McDermott';

var_dump($newName);
// ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```

### Don't write to global functions

Polluting globals is a bad practice in many languages because you could clash with another
library and the user of your API would be none-the-wiser until they get an exception in
production. Let's think about an example: what if you wanted to have a configuration array?
You could write a global function like `config()`, but it could clash with another library
that tried to do the same thing.

**Bad:**

```php
function config(): array
{
    return [
        'foo' => 'bar',
    ];
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class Configuration
{
    private $configuration = [];

    public function __construct(array $configuration)
    {
        $this->configuration = $configuration;
    }

    public function get(string $key): ?string
    {
        // null coalescing operator
        return $this->configuration[$key] ?? null;
    }
}
```

Load configuration and create an instance of the `Configuration` class

```php
$configuration = new Configuration([
    'foo' => 'bar',
]);
```

And now you must use the instance of `Configuration` in your application.

### Don't use a Singleton pattern

Singleton is an [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern). Paraphrased from Brian Button:
 1. They are generally used as a **global instance**, why is that so bad? Because **you hide the dependencies** of your application in your code, instead of exposing them through the interfaces. Making something global to avoid passing it around is a [code smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell).
 2. They violate the [single responsibility principle](#single-responsibility-principle-srp): by virtue of the fact that **they control their own creation and lifecycle**.
 3. They inherently cause code to be tightly [coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29). This makes faking them out under **test rather difficult** in many cases.
 4. They carry state around for the lifetime of the application. Another hit to testing since **you can end up with a situation where tests need to be ordered** which is a big no for unit tests. Why? Because each unit test should be independent of the other.

There are also very good thoughts by [Misko Hevery](http://misko.hevery.com/about/) about the [root of the problem](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/25/root-cause-of-singletons/).

**Bad:**

```php
class DBConnection
{
    private static $instance;

    private function __construct(string $dsn)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public static function getInstance(): self
    {
        if (self::$instance === null) {
            self::$instance = new self();
        }

        return self::$instance;
    }

    // ...
}

$singleton = DBConnection::getInstance();
```

**Good:**

```php
class DBConnection
{
    public function __construct(string $dsn)
    {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

Create an instance of `DBConnection` class and configure it with [DSN](http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.construct.php#refsect1-pdo.construct-parameters).

```php
$connection = new DBConnection($dsn);
```

And now you must use the instance of `DBConnection` in your application.

### Encapsulate conditionals

**Bad:**

```php
if ($article->state === 'published') {
    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```php
if ($article->isPublished()) {
    // ...
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid negative conditionals

**Bad:**

```php
function isDOMNodeNotPresent(DOMNode $node): bool
{
    // ...
}

if (! isDOMNodeNotPresent($node)) {
    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function isDOMNodePresent(DOMNode $node): bool
{
    // ...
}

if (isDOMNodePresent($node)) {
    // ...
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid conditionals

This seems like an impossible task. Upon first hearing this, most people say,
"how am I supposed to do anything without an `if` statement?" The answer is that
you can use polymorphism to achieve the same task in many cases. The second
question is usually, "well that's great but why would I want to do that?" The
answer is a previous clean code concept we learned: a function should only do
one thing. When you have classes and functions that have `if` statements, you
are telling your user that your function does more than one thing. Remember,
just do one thing.

**Bad:**

```php
class Airplane
{
    // ...

    public function getCruisingAltitude(): int
    {
        switch ($this->type) {
            case '777':
                return $this->getMaxAltitude() - $this->getPassengerCount();
            case 'Air Force One':
                return $this->getMaxAltitude();
            case 'Cessna':
                return $this->getMaxAltitude() - $this->getFuelExpenditure();
        }
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
interface Airplane
{
    // ...

    public function getCruisingAltitude(): int;
}

class Boeing777 implements Airplane
{
    // ...

    public function getCruisingAltitude(): int
    {
        return $this->getMaxAltitude() - $this->getPassengerCount();
    }
}

class AirForceOne implements Airplane
{
    // ...

    public function getCruisingAltitude(): int
    {
        return $this->getMaxAltitude();
    }
}

class Cessna implements Airplane
{
    // ...

    public function getCruisingAltitude(): int
    {
        return $this->getMaxAltitude() - $this->getFuelExpenditure();
    }
}
```

### Avoid type-checking (part 1)

PHP is untyped, which means your functions can take any type of argument.
Sometimes you are bitten by this freedom and it becomes tempting to do
type-checking in your functions. There are many ways to avoid having to do this.
The first thing to consider is consistent APIs.

**Bad:**

```php
function travelToTexas($vehicle): void
{
    if ($vehicle instanceof Bicycle) {
        $vehicle->pedalTo(new Location('texas'));
    } elseif ($vehicle instanceof Car) {
        $vehicle->driveTo(new Location('texas'));
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function travelToTexas(Vehicle $vehicle): void
{
    $vehicle->travelTo(new Location('texas'));
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid type-checking (part 2)

If you are working with basic primitive values like strings, integers, and arrays,
and you use PHP 7+ and you can't use polymorphism but you still feel the need to
type-check, you should consider
[type declaration](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php)
or strict mode. It provides you with static typing on top of standard PHP syntax.
The problem with manually type-checking is that doing it will require so much
extra verbiage that the faux "type-safety" you get doesn't make up for the lost
readability. Keep your PHP clean, write good tests, and have good code reviews.
Otherwise, do all of that but with PHP strict type declaration or strict mode.

**Bad:**

```php
function combine($val1, $val2): int
{
    if (! is_numeric($val1) || ! is_numeric($val2)) {
        throw new Exception('Must be of type Number');
    }

    return $val1 + $val2;
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function combine(int $val1, int $val2): int
{
    return $val1 + $val2;
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Remove dead code

Dead code is just as bad as duplicate code. There's no reason to keep it in
your codebase. If it's not being called, get rid of it! It will still be safe
in your version history if you still need it.

**Bad:**

```php
function oldRequestModule(string $url): void
{
    // ...
}

function newRequestModule(string $url): void
{
    // ...
}

$request = newRequestModule($requestUrl);
inventoryTracker('apples', $request, 'www.inventory-awesome.io');
```

**Good:**

```php
function requestModule(string $url): void
{
    // ...
}

$request = requestModule($requestUrl);
inventoryTracker('apples', $request, 'www.inventory-awesome.io');
```

## Objects and Data Structures

### Use object encapsulation

In PHP you can set `public`, `protected` and `private` keywords for methods.
Using it, you can control properties modification on an object.

* When you want to do more beyond getting an object property, you don't have
to look up and change every accessor in your codebase.
* Makes adding validation simple when doing a `set`.
* Encapsulates the internal representation.
* Easy to add logging and error handling when getting and setting.
* Inheriting this class, you can override default functionality.
* You can lazy load your object's properties, let's say getting it from a
server.

Additionally, this is part of the [Open/Closed](#openclosed-principle-ocp) principle.

**Bad:**

```php
class BankAccount
{
    public $balance = 1000;
}

$bankAccount = new BankAccount();

// Buy shoes...
$bankAccount->balance -= 100;
```

**Good:**

```php
class BankAccount
{
    private $balance;

    public function __construct(int $balance = 1000)
    {
      $this->balance = $balance;
    }

    public function withdraw(int $amount): void
    {
        if ($amount > $this->balance) {
            throw new \Exception('Amount greater than available balance.');
        }

        $this->balance -= $amount;
    }

    public function deposit(int $amount): void
    {
        $this->balance += $amount;
    }

    public function getBalance(): int
    {
        return $this->balance;
    }
}

$bankAccount = new BankAccount();

// Buy shoes...
$bankAccount->withdraw($shoesPrice);

// Get balance
$balance = $bankAccount->getBalance();
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Make objects have private/protected members

* `public` methods and properties are most dangerous for changes because some outside code may easily rely on them and you can't control what code relies on them. **Modifications in class are dangerous for all users of the class.**
* `protected` modifiers are as dangerous as public because they are available in the scope of any child class. This effectively means that difference between public and protected is only in the access mechanism, but the encapsulation guarantee remains the same. **Modifications in class are dangerous for all descendant classes.**
* `private` modifier guarantees that code is **dangerous to modify only within the boundaries of a single class** (you are safe for modifications and you won't have the [Jenga effect](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Jengaphobia&defid=2494196)).

Therefore, use `private` by default and `public/protected` when you need to provide access to external classes.

For more information, you can read the [blog post](http://fabien.potencier.org/pragmatism-over-theory-protected-vs-private.html) on this topic written by [Fabien Potencier](https://github.com/fabpot).

**Bad:**

```php
class Employee
{
    public $name;

    public function __construct(string $name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }
}

$employee = new Employee('John Doe');
// Employee name: John Doe
echo 'Employee name: ' . $employee->name;
```

**Good:**

```php
class Employee
{
    private $name;

    public function __construct(string $name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }
}

$employee = new Employee('John Doe');
// Employee name: John Doe
echo 'Employee name: ' . $employee->getName();
```

## Classes

### Prefer composition over inheritance

As stated famously in [*Design Patterns*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by the Gang of Four,
you should prefer composition over inheritance where you can. There are lots of
good reasons to use inheritance and lots of good reasons to use composition.
The main point of this maxim is that if your mind instinctively goes for an
inheritance, try to think if composition could model your problem better. In some
cases, it can.

You might be wondering then, "when should I use inheritance?" It
depends on your problem at hand, but this is a decent list of when inheritance
makes more sense than composition:

1. Your inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship and not a "has-a"
relationship (Human->Animal vs. User->UserDetails).
2. You can reuse code from the base classes (Humans can move like all animals).
3. You want to make global changes to derived classes by changing a base class.
(Change the caloric expenditure of all animals when they move).

**Bad:**

```php
class Employee
{
    private $name;

    private $email;

    public function __construct(string $name, string $email)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->email = $email;
    }

    // ...
}

// Bad because Employees "have" tax data.
// EmployeeTaxData is not a type of Employee

class EmployeeTaxData extends Employee
{
    private $ssn;

    private $salary;

    public function __construct(string $name, string $email, string $ssn, string $salary)
    {
        parent::__construct($name, $email);

        $this->ssn = $ssn;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class EmployeeTaxData
{
    private $ssn;

    private $salary;

    public function __construct(string $ssn, string $salary)
    {
        $this->ssn = $ssn;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    // ...
}

class Employee
{
    private $name;

    private $email;

    private $taxData;

    public function __construct(string $name, string $email)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->email = $email;
    }

    public function setTaxData(EmployeeTaxData $taxData): void
    {
        $this->taxData = $taxData;
    }

    // ...
}
```

### Avoid fluent interfaces

A [Fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) is an object-oriented API that aims to improve the readability of the source code by using
[Method chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining).

While there can be some contexts, frequently builder objects, where this
pattern reduces the verbosity of the code (for example the [PHPUnit Mock Builder](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/test-doubles.html)
or the [Doctrine Query Builder](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/query-builder.html)),
more often it comes at some costs:

1. Breaks [Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28object-oriented_programming%29).
2. Breaks [Decorators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern).
3. Is harder to [mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) in a test suite.
4. Makes the diffs in commits harder to read.

For more information, you can read the full [blog post](https://ocramius.github.io/blog/fluent-interfaces-are-evil/)
on this topic written by [Marco Pivetta](https://github.com/Ocramius).

**Bad:**

```php
class Car
{
    private $make = 'Honda';

    private $model = 'Accord';

    private $color = 'white';

    public function setMake(string $make): self
    {
        $this->make = $make;

        // NOTE: Returning this for chaining
        return $this;
    }

    public function setModel(string $model): self
    {
        $this->model = $model;

        // NOTE: Returning this for chaining
        return $this;
    }

    public function setColor(string $color): self
    {
        $this->color = $color;

        // NOTE: Returning this for chaining
        return $this;
    }

    public function dump(): void
    {
        var_dump($this->make, $this->model, $this->color);
    }
}

$car = (new Car())
    ->setColor('pink')
    ->setMake('Ford')
    ->setModel('F-150')
    ->dump();
```

**Good:**

```php
class Car
{
    private $make = 'Honda';

    private $model = 'Accord';

    private $color = 'white';

    public function setMake(string $make): void
    {
        $this->make = $make;
    }

    public function setModel(string $model): void
    {
        $this->model = $model;
    }

    public function setColor(string $color): void
    {
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    public function dump(): void
    {
        var_dump($this->make, $this->model, $this->color);
    }
}

$car = new Car();
$car->setColor('pink');
$car->setMake('Ford');
$car->setModel('F-150');
$car->dump();
```

### Prefer final classes

The `final` keyword should be used whenever possible:

1. It prevents an uncontrolled inheritance chain.
2. It encourages [composition](#prefer-composition-over-inheritance).
3. It encourages the [Single Responsibility Principle](#single-responsibility-principle-srp).
4. It encourages developers to use your public methods instead of extending the class to get access to protected ones.
5. It allows you to change your code without breaking applications that use your class.

The only condition is that your class should implement an interface and no other public methods are defined.

For more information, you can read [the blog post](https://ocramius.github.io/blog/when-to-declare-classes-final/) on this topic written by [Marco Pivetta (Ocramius)](https://ocramius.github.io/).

**Bad:**

```php
final class Car
{
    private $color;

    public function __construct($color)
    {
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    /**
     * @return string The color of the vehicle
     */
    public function getColor()
    {
        return $this->color;
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
interface Vehicle
{
    /**
     * @return string The color of the vehicle
     */
    public function getColor();
}

final class Car implements Vehicle
{
    private $color;

    public function __construct($color)
    {
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    public function getColor()
    {
        return $this->color;
    }

As stated in Clean Code, "There should never be more than one reason for a class
to change". It's tempting to jam-pack a class with a lot of functionality, like
when you can only take one suitcase on your flight. The issue with this is
that your class won't be conceptually cohesive and it will give it many reasons
to change. Minimizing the number of times you need to change a class is important.
It's important because if too much functionality is in one class and you modify a piece of it,
it can be difficult to understand how that will affect other dependent modules in
your codebase.

**Bad:**

```php
class UserSettings
{
    private $user;

    public function __construct(User $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }

    public function changeSettings(array $settings): void
    {
        if ($this->verifyCredentials()) {
            // ...
        }
    }

    private function verifyCredentials(): bool
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class UserAuth
{
    private $user;

    public function __construct(User $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }

    public function verifyCredentials(): bool
    {
        // ...
    }
}

class UserSettings
{
    private $user;

    private $auth;

    public function __construct(User $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
        $this->auth = new UserAuth($user);
    }

    public function changeSettings(array $settings): void
    {
        if ($this->auth->verifyCredentials()) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

As stated by Bertrand Meyer, "software entities (classes, modules, functions,
etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification." What does that
mean though? This principle basically states that you should allow users to
add new functionalities without changing existing code.

**Bad:**

```php
abstract class Adapter
{
    protected $name;

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }
}

class AjaxAdapter extends Adapter
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();

        $this->name = 'ajaxAdapter';
    }
}

class NodeAdapter extends Adapter
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();

        $this->name = 'nodeAdapter';
    }
}

class HttpRequester
{
    private $adapter;

    public function __construct(Adapter $adapter)
    {
        $this->adapter = $adapter;
    }

    public function fetch(string $url): Promise
    {
        $adapterName = $this->adapter->getName();

        if ($adapterName === 'ajaxAdapter') {
            return $this->makeAjaxCall($url);
        } elseif ($adapterName === 'httpNodeAdapter') {
            return $this->makeHttpCall($url);
        }
    }

    private function makeAjaxCall(string $url): Promise
    {
        // request and return promise
    }

    private function makeHttpCall(string $url): Promise
    {
        // request and return promise
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
interface Adapter
{
    public function request(string $url): Promise;
}

class AjaxAdapter implements Adapter
{
    public function request(string $url): Promise
    {
        // request and return promise
    }
}

class NodeAdapter implements Adapter
{
    public function request(string $url): Promise
    {
        // request and return promise
    }
}

class HttpRequester
{
    private $adapter;

    public function __construct(Adapter $adapter)
    {
        $this->adapter = $adapter;
    }

    public function fetch(string $url): Promise
    {
        return $this->adapter->request($url);
    }
}
```

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

This is a scary term for a very simple concept. It's formally defined as "If S
is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S
(i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any
of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed,
etc.)." That's an even scarier definition.

The best explanation for this is if you have a parent class and a child class,
then the base class and child class can be used interchangeably without getting
incorrect results. This might still be confusing, so let's take a look at the
classic Square-Rectangle example. Mathematically, a square is a rectangle, but
if you model it using the "is-a" relationship via inheritance, you quickly
get into trouble.

**Bad:**

```php
class Rectangle
{
    protected $width = 0;

    protected $height = 0;

    public function setWidth(int $width): void
    {
        $this->width = $width;
    }

    public function setHeight(int $height): void
    {
        $this->height = $height;
    }

    public function getArea(): int
    {
        return $this->width * $this->height;
    }
}

class Square extends Rectangle
{
    public function setWidth(int $width): void
    {
        $this->width = $this->height = $width;
    }

    public function setHeight(int $height): void
    {
        $this->width = $this->height = $height;
    }
}

function printArea(Rectangle $rectangle): void
{
    $rectangle->setWidth(4);
    $rectangle->setHeight(5);

    // BAD: Will return 25 for Square. Should be 20.
    echo sprintf('%s has area %d.', get_class($rectangle), $rectangle->getArea()) . PHP_EOL;
}

$rectangles = [new Rectangle(), new Square()];

foreach ($rectangles as $rectangle) {
    printArea($rectangle);
}
```

**Good:**

The best way is separate the quadrangles and allocation of a more general subtype for both shapes.

Despite the apparent similarity of the square and the rectangle, they are different.
A square has much in common with a rhombus, and a rectangle with a parallelogram, but they are not subtypes.
A square, a rectangle, a rhombus and a parallelogram are separate shapes with their own properties, albeit similar.

```php
interface Shape
{
    public function getArea(): int;
}

class Rectangle implements Shape
{
    private $width = 0;
    private $height = 0;

    public function __construct(int $width, int $height)
    {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }

    public function getArea(): int
    {
        return $this->width * $this->height;
    }
}

class Square implements Shape
{
    private $length = 0;

    public function __construct(int $length)
    {
        $this->length = $length;
    }

    public function getArea(): int
    {
        return $this->length ** 2;
    }
}

function printArea(Shape $shape): void
{
    echo sprintf('%s has area %d.', get_class($shape), $shape->getArea()).PHP_EOL;
}

$shapes = [new Rectangle(4, 5), new Square(5)];

foreach ($shapes as $shape) {
    printArea($shape);
}
```

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

ISP states that "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that
they do not use."

A good example to look at that demonstrates this principle is for
classes that require large settings objects. Not requiring clients to set up
huge amounts of options is beneficial, because most of the time they won't need
all of the settings. Making them optional helps prevent having a "fat interface".

**Bad:**

```php
interface Employee
{
    public function work(): void;

    public function eat(): void;
}

class HumanEmployee implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }

    public function eat(): void
    {
        // ...... eating in lunch break
    }
}

class RobotEmployee implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        //.... working much more
    }

    public function eat(): void
    {
        //.... robot can't eat, but it must implement this method
    }
}
```

**Good:**

Not every worker is an employee, but every employee is a worker.

```php
interface Workable
{
    public function work(): void;
}

interface Feedable
{
    public function eat(): void;
}

interface Employee extends Feedable, Workable
{
}

class HumanEmployee implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }

    public function eat(): void
    {
        //.... eating in lunch break
    }
}

// robot can only work
class RobotEmployee implements Workable
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }
}
```

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

This principle states two essential things:
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend on
abstractions.

This can be hard to understand at first, but if you've worked with PHP frameworks (like Symfony), you've seen an implementation of this principle in the form of Dependency
Injection (DI). While they are not identical concepts, DIP keeps high-level
modules from knowing the details of their low-level modules and setting them up.
It can accomplish this through DI. A huge benefit of this is that it reduces
the coupling between modules. Coupling is a very bad development pattern because
it makes your code hard to refactor.

**Bad:**

```php
class Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }
}

class Robot extends Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        //.... working much more
    }
}

class Manager
{
    private $employee;

    public function __construct(Employee $employee)
    {
        $this->employee = $employee;
    }

    public function manage(): void
    {
        $this->employee->work();
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
interface Employee
{
    public function work(): void;
}

class Human implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }
}

class Robot implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        //.... working much more
    }
}

class Manager
{
    private $employee;

    public function __construct(Employee $employee)
    {
        $this->employee = $employee;
    }

    public function manage(): void
    {
        $this->employee->work();
    }
}
```

## Don’t repeat yourself (DRY)

Try to observe the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle.

Do your absolute best to avoid duplicate code. Duplicate code is bad because
it means that there's more than one place to alter something if you need to
change some logic.

Imagine if you run a restaurant and you keep track of your inventory: all your
tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices, etc. If you have multiple lists that
you keep this on, then all have to be updated when you serve a dish with
tomatoes in them. If you only have one list, there's only one place to update it!

Often you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly
different things, that share a lot in common, but their differences force you
to have two or more separate functions that do much of the same things. Removing
duplicate code means creating an abstraction that can handle this set of different
things with just one function/module/class.

Getting the abstraction right is critical, that's why you should follow the
SOLID principles laid out in the [Classes](#classes) section. Bad abstractions can be
worse than duplicate code, so be careful! Having said this, if you can make
a good abstraction, do it! Don't repeat yourself, otherwise, you'll find yourself
updating multiple places any time you want to change one thing.

**Bad:**

```php
function showDeveloperList(array $developers): void
{
    foreach ($developers as $developer) {
        $expectedSalary = $developer->calculateExpectedSalary();
        $experience = $developer->getExperience();
        $githubLink = $developer->getGithubLink();
        $data = [$expectedSalary, $experience, $githubLink];

        render($data);
    }
}

function showManagerList(array $managers): void
{
    foreach ($managers as $manager) {
        $expectedSalary = $manager->calculateExpectedSalary();
        $experience = $manager->getExperience();
        $githubLink = $manager->getGithubLink();
        $data = [$expectedSalary, $experience, $githubLink];

        render($data);
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function showList(array $employees): void
{
    foreach ($employees as $employee) {
        $expectedSalary = $employee->calculateExpectedSalary();
        $experience = $employee->getExperience();
        $githubLink = $employee->getGithubLink();
        $data = [$expectedSalary, $experience, $githubLink];

        render($data);
    }
}
```

**Very good:**

It is better to use a compact version of the code.

```php
function showList(array $employees): void
{
    foreach ($employees as $employee) {
        render([$employee->calculateExpectedSalary(), $employee->getExperience(), $employee->getGithubLink()]);
    }
}
```
